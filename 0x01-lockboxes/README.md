# Lockboxes Problem Solution

## Overview

The Lockboxes problem is a classic algorithmic challenge where you need to determine if all the boxes can be unlocked given a starting point and keys contained in each box. The solution uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) with Python list comprehensions to efficiently explore and unlock all reachable boxes.

## Problem Statement

You have `n` locked boxes, numbered from `0` to `n-1`. Each box may contain keys to other boxes. The goal is to determine if all boxes can be unlocked, starting from the first box (`boxes[0]`), which is unlocked initially.

### Function Prototype

```python
def canUnlockAll(boxes):
    """
    Determines if all the boxes can be unlocked.

    Parameters:
    boxes (List[List[int]]): A list of lists where each inner list contains keys to other boxes.

    Returns:
    bool: True if all boxes can be unlocked, otherwise False.
    """
```

## Description

### Input

- **`boxes`**: A list of lists, where each inner list contains keys (represented as integers) that open other boxes. 

### Output

- **Returns**: `True` if all boxes can be unlocked; otherwise, `False`.

### How It Works

1. **Initialization**:
   - Start with the first box (`box 0`), which is initially unlocked.
   - Create a list called `visited` to keep track of which boxes have been unlocked.
   - Use a `queue` to manage the boxes that need to be explored.

2. **BFS Traversal**:
   - Process each box in the queue:
     - If a box has not been visited:
       - Mark it as visited.
       - Retrieve all keys from this box.
       - Use list comprehension to filter keys for boxes that haven't been visited yet.
       - Add these newly accessible boxes to the queue.

3. **Completion Check**:
   - After processing all reachable boxes, check if all boxes have been visited to determine if it is possible to unlock all of them.

### Detailed Example

Given the following list of boxes:

```python
boxes = [[1], [2], [3], [4], []]
```

1. **Initialization**:
   - `visited = [False, False, False, False, False]`
   - `queue = [0]` (Start with box 0)

2. **Processing Box 0**:
   - Keys in box 0: `[1]`
   - Mark box 0 as visited: `visited = [True, False, False, False, False]`
   - Add box 1 (key `1`) to the queue: `queue = [1]`

3. **Processing Box 1**:
   - Keys in box 1: `[2]`
   - Mark box 1 as visited: `visited = [True, True, False, False, False]`
   - Add box 2 (key `2`) to the queue: `queue = [2]`

4. **Processing Box 2**:
   - Keys in box 2: `[3]`
   - Mark box 2 as visited: `visited = [True, True, True, False, False]`
   - Add box 3 (key `3`) to the queue: `queue = [3]`

5. **Processing Box 3**:
   - Keys in box 3: `[4]`
   - Mark box 3 as visited: `visited = [True, True, True, True, False]`
   - Add box 4 (key `4`) to the queue: `queue = [4]`

6. **Processing Box 4**:
   - Keys in box 4: `[]` (No keys)
   - Mark box 4 as visited: `visited = [True, True, True, True, True]`
   - Queue is empty.

7. **Completion**:
   - All boxes have been visited: `visited = [True, True, True, True, True]`
   - Function returns `True`.

## Usage

### Example Code

```python
from lockboxes import canUnlockAll

# Test cases
boxes1 = [[1], [2], [3], [4], []]
print(canUnlockAll(boxes1))  # Output: True

boxes2 = [[1, 4, 6], [2], [0, 4, 1], [5, 6, 2], [3], [4, 1], [6]]
print(canUnlockAll(boxes2))  # Output: True

boxes3 = [[1, 4], [2], [0, 4, 1], [3], [], [4, 1], [5, 6]]
print(canUnlockAll(boxes3))  # Output: False
```
