# Minimum Operations to Achieve `n` H Characters

This project provides a Python function to determine the minimum number of operations needed to achieve exactly `n` `H` characters in a text file, starting with a single `H`. The allowed operations are "Copy All" and "Paste".

## Problem Description

You are given a text file initially containing a single `H` character. You can perform two operations on this file:
- **Copy All**: Copies all characters currently in the file to the clipboard.
- **Paste**: Pastes the clipboard's content to the file.

The challenge is to calculate the minimum number of operations required to end up with exactly `n` `H` characters in the file. If it is not possible to achieve exactly `n` `H` characters, the function should return `0`.

## Function

### `minOperations(n)`

#### Parameters
- `n` (int): The desired number of `H` characters in the file.

#### Returns
- `int`: The minimum number of operations needed to achieve exactly `n` `H` characters. If it is not possible, the function returns `0`.

## How It Works

To determine the minimum number of operations, the function relies on the mathematical concept of factorization. Here’s a breakdown of the approach:

1. **Factorisation**: 
   - The function factorizes the number `n` to determine the prime factors. Each prime factor represents a potential copy-paste operation cycle.
   - For each prime factor `p`, the function performs a "Copy All" operation and then uses "Paste" operations to reach the total count of `n` characters.

2. **Operations Count**:
   - For each prime factor `p`, the function adds the factor value to the total operations count. This is because, for each factor, you need to copy the current content and then paste `p - 1` times to multiply the content to reach the desired number of `H` characters.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it returns `0` because no operations are needed or it’s impossible to reach the desired count.

### Example Usage

Here’s how you can use the `minOperations` function:

```python
from minoperations import minOperations

# Example 1: Calculating operations for n = 4
n = 4
print("Min # of operations to reach {} char: {}".format(n, minOperations(n)))
# Output: Min # of operations to reach 4 char: 4

# Example 2: Calculating operations for n = 12
n = 12
print("Min # of operations to reach {} char: {}".format(n, minOperations(n)))
# Output: Min # of operations to reach 12 char: 7
